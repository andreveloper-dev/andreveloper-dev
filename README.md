## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Data Engineer** with a strong foundation in electronics engineering and ongoing graduate studies in Analytical Engineering. I specialize in building **end-to-end data solutions** that transform raw data into actionable insights and scalable production systems.

My expertise spans the entire **data lifecycle**: from designing robust ETL/ELT pipelines and building data warehouses, to developing predictive models and deploying ML systems in production. I combine deep technical knowledge in distributed computing, statistical modeling, and cloud-native architectures to solve complex analytical problems at scale.
